## Accommodation

The Marine and Freshwater Research Institute (MFRI) has established a formal partnership with two hotels in regard to the WGFAST meeting to be held in Iceland April 2025.

Both hotels offer 15% discount from the regular rate when participant book with codes provided here below.

-   Fosshótel Reykjavik, a new and quite big hotel, is located close (walking distance) to both the seaside and Reykjavik´s city centre. Book here by using the code Marine0425. There is a minimum of 3 nights to be able to obtain the discount while booking the rooms.

-   The other hotel also offers 15% discount. It is quite different from the Reykjavik hótel, called the Hotel Viking in Hafnarfjordur, close to MFRI´s headquarters and the location of the WGFAST meetings. The hotel is quite small but comfy with a Viking style theme.

To book Hotel Viking you need to send an email to book by using the code WGFAST sent to mottaka\@fjorukrain.is (spare email is unnur\@fjorukrain.is).

Note that WGFAST guests will be responsible for their own hotel bookings. MFRI will not interfere or contact the hotels on their behalf.

Another option in Hafnarfjörður in a walking distance (\~15 minutes walk and bit out of the downtown) is Hotel Vellir; https://hotelvellir.com/. Please make a booking at info\@hotelvellir.com and indicate the word “Hafro” in the subject.
