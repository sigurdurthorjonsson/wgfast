Both hotels offer 15% discount from the regular rate when participant book with codes provided here below.

Fosshótel Reykjavik, a new and quite big hotel, is located close (walking distance) to both the seaside and Reykjavik´s city centre.

The other hotel also offers 15% discount. It is quite different from the Reykjavik hótel, called the Hotel Viking in Hafnarfjordur, close to MFRI´s headquarters and the location of the WGFAST meetings. The hotel is quite small but comfy with a Viking style theme.

Note that WGFAST guests will be responsible for their own hotel bookings. MFRI will not interfere or contact the hotels on their behalf.

## Meeting venue

The meeting will take place at the The Marine and Freshwater Research
Institute´s (MFRI) headquarters at Fornubúðir 4,
Hafnarfjörður. Approximately 2/3 of the institute's employees are
based there. Fornubúðir accommodates various specialized laboratories,
a lecture hall and the workspace of most of the employees. The harbour
close to Fornubúðir is also the home base for MFRI´s research vessels,
Árni Friðriksson HF 200 and Þórunn Þórðardóttir HF 300.  The town of
Hafnarfjörður is on the outskirts of the capital area. In 2024 around
31.000 people lived in the town that has grown substantially in the
last decades. The harbour that the name of the town is drawn from was
one of the largest from the 16th century and a significant fishing
port through Iceland´s history. Find out more about Hafnarfjörður
