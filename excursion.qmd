*Note that this excursion will be adapted to the situation of the Sundhnjúkagígar system. An eruption has been predicted for a while and might be overdue. We assume it will continue to be possible to explore Reykjanesskagi.* 

*Check out the news and alerts about the [volcanic activity](https://en.vedur.is/volcanoes/fagradalsfjall-eruption/news-and-alerts/) as well as the news about recent [earthquakes](https://en.vedur.is/earthquakes-and-volcanism/earthquakes/reykjanespeninsula/) in the Reykjanes peninsula.*

**Price for the excursion will be 5.000 ISK (close to 35 euros) per participant, to cover bus and some light refreshments.
_Payment will be done on the last day_**

## Draft agenda for an excursion

-   13:00 Departure Reykjavík.

-   13:20 Photo opportunity at Kleifarvatn

-   13:30--35 Seltún (the geysirs of Krísuvík) 30 minutes.

-   14:00 Trek into the Nátthagi ('nighttime pasture') area and around Borgarfjall ('burg mountain') or around it and the volcanic sites of 2020--2021 explored. At present it is hardly realistic to aim for the most recent volcanic craters, but that might change.

This is an approximately 1.5 hours long walk.

-   15:45 Drive to the MFRI Aquaculture facility at Staður ('Place') with sightseeing and refreshments.

-   16:30 Onwards further west to Reykjanes --- Gunnuhver and the Toe of Reykjanes, continental divide and after that back to Reykjavík. ETA approx 18--19.
