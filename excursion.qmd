*Check out the news and alerts about the [volcanic activity](https://en.vedur.is/volcanoes/fagradalsfjall-eruption/news-and-alerts/) as well as the news about recent [earthquakes](https://en.vedur.is/earthquakes-and-volcanism/earthquakes/reykjanespeninsula/) in the Reykjanes peninsula.*

**Price for the excursion will be 5.000 ISK (close to 35 euros) per participant, to cover bus and some light refreshments.
_Payment will be done on the last day_**
