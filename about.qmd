# Overview

## The Marine and Freshwater Research Institute

![MFRI Logo](images/hafro.png){style="float:right;padding: 0 0 0 10px;" fig-alt="MFRI Logo" width="100"}

The Marine and Freshwater Research Institute (MFRI) is a leading research institute in Iceland, focusing on marine and freshwater ecosystems. For more information, visit the [MFRI website](https://www.hafogvatn.is/en).

### Set up

We want you to have a working LSSS installation on your computer, and have a good deal of free space either on the computer or on a relatively fast external disk. We will gather course materials on a hard disk and also give file references to data sets on Hafrónet.

The Working Group on Fisheries Acoustics, Science and Technology (WGFAST) is an expert group under the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). WGFAST focuses on the development and application of acoustic methods to study marine ecosystems.

## Objectives

-   **Advance Acoustic Methods**: To advance the use of acoustic methods in fisheries and ecosystem research.
-   **Information Exchange**: To provide a forum for the exchange of information and ideas among scientists.
-   **Standardization**: To promote the standardization of acoustic methods and data analysis techniques.

## Activities

WGFAST organizes annual meetings, workshops, and training courses to facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing among scientists. The group also produces scientific reports and publications to disseminate research findings.

### Annual Meetings

WGFAST holds annual meetings where scientists present their latest research, discuss new technologies, and collaborate on projects. These meetings are a great opportunity to network and learn from experts in the field.

### Workshops and Training

WGFAST conducts workshops and training sessions on various topics related to fisheries acoustics. These events are designed to help scientists and researchers improve their skills and stay updated with the latest advancements.

### Publications

WGFAST publishes scientific reports and papers that contribute to the body of knowledge in fisheries acoustics. These publications are valuable resources for researchers and practitioners.
